# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: February 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: FileMaker Work yesterday. I implemented a search in a set of 3 different fields in a portal. The results are filtered as you type. Turns out my weather app didn't have a problem. The problem was with the weather server. Today I added code and pictures to change the background image depending on the weather.  #100DaysOfCode
